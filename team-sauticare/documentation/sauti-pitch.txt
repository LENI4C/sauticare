Introduction
 “Good [morning/afternoon] judges. Thank you for having us.
We are here to introduce SautiCare — A Caring Voice for Mental Health.
In Nigeria, millions silently struggle with stress, trauma, and anxiety. But stigma, high costs, and language barriers keep them from getting help.
Our vision is simple but powerful. which is to use AI and local languages to make mental health support accessible, stigma-free, and culturally relevant.”

The Problem
 “Let’s start with the challenge we’re addressing.
Across Nigeria, especially among youth and internally displaced persons, mental health struggles are growing. Yet services remain scarce: there are very few professionals, services are costly, and stigma makes people stay silent.
Even when digital tools exist, they often ignore language. A young person in Maiduguri may prefer Hausa, or a university student might express themselves best in Pidgin, but most apps only support English.
So, those who need help the most, are the ones left out.”

Our Solution
 “That’s where SautiCare comes in.
SautiCare is an AI-powered chatbot that provides mental health first-aid in English, Pidgin, and Hausa.
It offers a safe, stigma-free space where anyone can:
•	Chat about how they feel.
•	Receive empathetic, human-like responses.
•	Learn coping strategies or access helpful resources.
•	And, when it’s critical, get guided to professional helplines instantly.
It’s lightweight, mobile-friendly, and built specifically for underserved communities.”

Key Features
 “SautiCare focuses on four unique features:
1.	Multilingual support Basically English, Pidgin, Hausa.
2.	Empathetic conversations
3.	Crisis detection by spotting words like suicide or hopeless, and immediately connecting the user to hotlines.
4.	Resource library and much more
All of this comes in a calm, mobile-first interface made for youth and displaced communities.”

Why It Matters
 “These matters deeply.
Mental health is surrounded by silence and stigma. But when someone opens SautiCare, they enter a safe, anonymous space to express themselves without fear.
By including local languages, we’re breaking barriers of exclusion.
And because it’s AI-powered and scalable, one chatbot can grow into millions of conversations — each one helping someone feel a little less alone.”

Progress & Goals
 “In terms of progress, here’s where we are:
•	We’ve built a cross-functional team combining AI, design, and engineering.
•	We’ve finalized our idea and mapped the system architecture.
•	We’ve already started prototypes and chatbot conversation flows.
By the end of this hackathon, our goal is to deliver a working prototype that demonstrates:
•	Multilingual conversations.
•	Crisis detection with hotline referral.
•	And a calming, mobile-friendly UI.
We don’t just want to show a concept, we want you to experience what it feels like to have a caring voice available anytime.”

Speaker:
“On the technical side, SautiCare is built to be lightweight but scalable.
•	Frontend: React/Next.js with TailwindCSS.
•	Backend: Node.js/Express with secure APIs.
•	AI/ML: Rasa or HuggingFace NLP for multilingual understanding.
•	Database: Postgres or MongoDB.
•	Design: Figma prototypes.
•	Deployment: Cloud hosting on Render or Heroku.
This stack allows us to move fast during the hackathon while ensuring future scalability.”

SautiCare is more than just a project. It’s a caring voice for mental health.
Built by a team who believes technology can make support accessible, stigma-free, and culturally relevant.
Because at the end of the day, everyone deserves someone to talk to, and they deserve to be heard in a language they understand.
